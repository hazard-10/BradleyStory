I am in college library. The weather is horrible outside. As students walk to class in sub zero temperatures, many wonder why they decided to go to school in Wisconsin. They remember that the cold will only last for a little longer as we head into Spring. As Spring is around the corner, I remember how nice Madison is when it's warm out.
