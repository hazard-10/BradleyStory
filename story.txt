I am in college library. The weather is horrible outside. As students walk to class in sub zero temperatures, many wonder why they decided to go to school in Wisconsin. They remember that the cold will only last for a little longer as we head into Spring. As Spring is around the corner, I remember how nice Madison is when it's warm out. In the summer, the climate outside is pleasant. I can eat as much ice cream as I want without getting a cold. I don't even need to wear any winter clothes, so I can step out of my apartment wearing shorts and not have to worry about anything. And then it gets to be like 80 to 90 degrees and that's a little too hot for me. I definitely appreciate it more than the cold, but like, why is it simultaneously too hot and too cold here? Up north gets just cold and that's nice because theu get to prepare for just cold and down south they get just warm. Why are we stuck with polar opposites.
I guess we are all lost boys in the Winter.
